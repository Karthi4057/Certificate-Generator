The Certificate Generator is a web-based application designed to automate the creation of digital certificates for events, courses, and workshops. 
The system allows administrators to enter participant details such as name, course title, and date, and automatically generates personalized certificates in a predefined format.
This eliminates manual certificate preparation, reduces errors, and saves time while ensuring consistency and accuracy.
